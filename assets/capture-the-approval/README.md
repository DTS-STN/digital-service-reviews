## Overview

We developed Capture the Approval as a workshop activity for FWD50 2022. [read about it here] Here you’ll find the materials and information you need to run your own version of this game.

The goal of the activity is to show the blockers that product teams have to face when trying to build and deliver services in the government context.  

The game is adaptable so you can create something that works for your organization. Capture the Approval is meant to be fun for both the organizers and participants. 

This materials package includes what we used to run our workshop. Use it as is, or customize the scenario and blockers for your needs. You’ll provide a scenario to participants who will complete tasks and seek approvals. You don’t have to follow our preamble exactly – just be sure to present a problem space and provide brief instructions for gameplay.

The game is meant to generate conversation with participants, so we encourage you to set aside enough time for fruitful post-game discussions.
## Materials needed
To host this activity, you’ll need the following: 
* A scenario of your choosing (problem space; use [ours](#our-scenario) or make your own)
* Print materials ([PDF](), [DOCX]())
  * Handout with game instructions 
  * Handout with discussion questions
  * Wildcards (recommend 2 per table)
  * Guidance for approvers
* Markers/pens
* Chart paper
* Stickers (for approvals)
* Timer for 25 minutes (plus additional time for post-game discussions)

## Our scenario and blockers
### Our scenario
>Good afternoon. I am from the office of the Assistant Deputy Minister of Dairy and Milk-Alternative Frozen Treats (DMAFT). ADM DMAFT couldn’t be here, but welcomes you all as our newest agile team working in a digital way. We’re trying out this human-centred approach in delivering treats.
>
>Of course, we aren’t changing any of the ways that the rest of us work, or the wider bureaucracy as a whole. 
Your team is testing out these ways of working but have to adhere to the way we do things in the Dairy and Milk-Alternative Frozen Treats Branch. We have established processes, rules and governance that must be respected
>
>But I’m not just here to say hello. The Minister of Sweet and Savoury Desserts has flagged an urgent situation that we have assigned to your teams. It has been an unseasonable warm summer and we are seeing high volumes of demands for frozen treats. 
>
>There are reports in national media of long lines at a popular ice cream store that released new flavours. People are standing for hours in rain and shine. Bike racks are full and there is no parking left. Wait times are longer than anticipated.
>
>ADM DMAFT requires each team to complete four tasks, laid out in your instructions.
>
>First, define a problem. Are people too tired after waiting in line? Does the store run out of flavours? Do they not take tap, making payment slower? Make your own assumptions to define the problem. Next, come up with potential solutions. Third, how do you assess solutions? Finally, make a recommendation for the Minister.
>
>We also require you to complete additional tasks to secure our approvals. Raise your table number to flag us to ask for approval. Please refer to the instructions and the cue card on your table. You have 25 minutes to complete four tasks and respond to this urgent issue.

### Our blockers
We embedded blockers into gameplay (e.g. encouraging our approvers to get into character; wildcards). While many were pre-planned, some blockers arose naturally when we hosted the inaugural game and we had fun responding to day-of challenges (e.g. audio-visual challenges; missing chart paper)! We encourage you to roll with the flow and confront last minute changes and challenges by incorporating them into your game. Some blockers we incorporated are outlined in the chart below.

| What the blocker represents  | Blockers during gameplay |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| New direction (due to changing priorities, new senior leadership)  | Brainstorm an additional solution  |
| Briefing new executive on something your team has already done  | Redraw one of the drawings from one of the tasks  |
| Attrition, burnout | One team member sits out for a task |
| No more funding | Do not complete task 4; write about lessons learned from tasks 1-3. This wildcard was only associated with the last task so that all teams could participate in all tasks |
| Not having the right tools for the job, requiring teams to creatively respond to the challenge | AV difficulties, missing materials* (no chart paper or blue markers for drawing blue whales) |
| New leadership, structural re-organization | Reassign new team leader |
| Deadlines, insufficient time to complete task; approval delays | Game has been designed to feel rushed; approvers were asked to be unpredictable. |

## FAQs
### **What was the response like when you ran this workshop at FWD50?**
>Read about it on [our blog](medium.com/good-trouble) 🙂. 

### **Any other gameplay mechanics to keep in mind?**
#### Psychological safety
>This game is meant to show the frustrations that product teams experience, but make sure that your participants are not feeling bad or ashamed because they aren’t doing the activity “correctly.” We encourage that you intentionally foster psychological safety for your participants – there are no wrong answers; make this clear!

#### Blockers
>In general, we introduced each blocker to have a real-life parallel–we wanted to avoid frustrating participants only for the sake of adding chaos. Feel free to come up with your own that you think will resonate. 
>
>We had one of our “approvers” only speak French, some of them would go on vacation, and we would occasionally ignore some tables. We ran into unplanned blockers and had fun incorporating them during our inaugural session. Many were easy to weave into our narrative. We introduced blockers only after task 1 was completed so that participants could get a feel for the game first.

### **Are there any restrictions on using these materials?**
>[No commercial use](#licensing). Please give credit and if possible, we’d love to hear about how your workshop went!

### **How can we run this activity virtually?**
>We tested out this workshop using a Miro board for the team to draw virtually, but we only worked with one group of 5-8 people. The secret blockers were hidden until they applied. Ideally this workshop is run in-person if there are multiple groups. Feel free to adapt these instructions for a virtual space. Tell us how it goes, we’d love to see it!

### **Can I give feedback on this workshop/materials?**
