# What are Digital Service Reviews?
Applying the Government of Canada's Digital Standards in digital service design, development, and delivery.

**Digital Service Reviews mark the end of each phase in the service design lifecycle.** Their outcome is to decide how the team and work should evolve going forward – whether to move to the next phase, make some changes before proceeding, or pivot to pursue a new direction.

Reviews are an opportunity for the team to reflect on what they’ve learned or created during the last phase and what they want to do similarly or differently for the next phase.

During a review, the product team shares the work they completed during the last phase of service design and demonstrates how they respond to users’ needs by meeting the Digital Standards.

It also helps our team at DECD gather lessons learned so we can share those experiences to help guide future teams.

Each review will be a little different to meet the varying needs and contexts of product teams.

The Digital Standards are “the foundation of the government’s shift to becoming more agile, open, and user-focused.”

## What are the Digital Standards?
The 10 Digital Standards are outlined in the Government of Canada Digital Standards Playbook:

1. Design with users
